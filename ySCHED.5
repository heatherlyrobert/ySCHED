.SH SUMMARY
ySCHED is a simple, elegant, powerful, and extended kernighan scheduling
grammar that builds on the classic cron implementation to enable support of
all schedule-based application (like calendaring).

.SH A) SCHEDULING
each input record contains a kernighan scheduling grammar string which is
independently parsable and is pure 8bit ascii text made up of 5 to 7 fields
delimited by any number of spaces.  the fields are...
   1) minutes      0 - 59 minutes
   2) hours        0 - 23 hours
   3) days         1 - 28/31 days, depending on month
   4) months       1 - 12 months
   5) week days    1 (monday) to 7 (sunday)
   6) weeks        0 to 53 weeks of year, 1 is first full week
   7) years        0 (2000) to 50 (2050)

all these fields are combined through AND logic to determine when a job is
scheduled to launch.  as a note, most crons use OR logic with day/dow we prefer
AND.  and, most do not include the week or year field which can lead to
overly clever scriping attempts or off-book recording by admins.

i will assume the reader has studied crontabs a little or can otherwise
learn from the internet. i will focus on lesser known and ySCHED specific
knowledge.

.SS center dot
the dot () makes schedule entries a little more readable, i have make the
center dot () a synonym for * as the general wildcard.  * is more clear
with steps.

.SS basic examples, should be general cron knowledge

.SH B) MODIFIERS
actual scheduling is often complex, varying for a host of reasons.  rather than
having seperate schedules for every variation, a more complex grammar than
simple literals is required.

.SS simple modifiers
are a way to be very specific about turning an exact time ON or OFF.  there are
four types of single value entries -- normal, not, reverse, inverse.
  1) normal        10       specifically turns 10 on
  2) not           !10      specifically turns 10 off
  3) reverse       ^10      specifically turns max - 10 on
  4) inverse       ~10      specifically turns all on except 10

#min-- -hrs-- day--- mon--- dow---
0      6-10,!8                   6a, 7a, 9a, and 10a
0      14     ^1                  2p on the next to last day
0      14     ~5-10               2p the 1-4 and 11-31
0      0      <5                  midnight on the 1st to 5th
0      0      10>                 midnight 10th to month end

.SS range modifiers
are a quick shorthand to designate a continuous range of values, rather than
list them.  there are four types of ranges -- lesser, greater, between, and
wildcard.  all ranges are inclusive, meaning the literal numbers are included.
  1) lesser         <10      all values less that or equal to 10
  2) greater        22>      all values greater that or equal to 22
  3) between        5-17     all values between 5 and 17, inclusive
  4) wildcard               all legal values
  -) not            !<5      turn off the first six
  -) reverse        ^0-4     turn on the last five
  -) inverse        ~5-17    all except 5-17

.SS list modifiers
are a way of turning on several different values in a particular field.  this
is done by separating with commas.
  1) values        10,12    turn on both 10 and 12
  2) mixed         5-8,15   turn on 5, 6, 7, 8, and 15
  -) not           5-8,!6-7 turn on 5 and 8 (6, 7 forced off)
  -) reverse       0-4,^0-4 turn on the first and last five

.SS step modifiers
are a way to jump through a ist, like with increments in c-for statements.
  1) ranges        3-9/3    jumps by 3x, so 3, 6, and 9
  2) wildcards     */4      means 1, 5, 9, 13, ... up to max
  -) not           !6-10/2  turn off 6, 8, and 10

.SS nearest modifiers
is a way to ensure a week day or a weekend day.  if the week day options are
already on a week day, the date is unchanged.  same for the weekend versions.
  1) week day before       15b   first week day before 15th
  2) week day after        20a   first week day after the 20th
  3) week day nearest      7n    nearest week day to the 7th
  4) weekend day before    12B   first sunday before 12th
  5) weekend day after     5A    first saturday after the 5th
  6) weekend day nearest   2N    nearest weekend day to the 2nd

.SH D) EFFECTIVE
some programs require effective dates and blackout scheduling, khronos (cron)
absolutely does.  this is a program-by-program decision, but here is the
method.  ySCHED technically has no involvement or understanding.

many scheduled jobs are added, removed, or transitioned at specific times,
rather than immediately.  rather than paying a programmer to remember and wait,
an administrator can use validity dates.

to achieve effective date setting, i settled on creating apparently normal
scheduling records at the top of the file with special tracker names...
   .valid     sets when the file is valid/lines can run
   .only      turns on specific times (rest are disallowed)
   .blackout  turns off specific times (can accumulate)
   .retire    sets when the file is not-valid/nothing can run

.B NOTE :
effective dates with  symbol ignore entries in weekday and weeks fields.
those two fields still need to exist and be valid, but just put wildcard ().

.SS .valid
validity can be anything, but typically it would indicate that after a specific
date and time the lines can start running.  to indicate on and after, prepend
line with '' symbol and a space.

.B WARNING :
default validity on a file is never.  so, if there is no .valid record in an
program type requiring one, nothing will ever run.

.nf

 55  21  15  4         22  valid starting April 15 at 9:55p

.SS .only
same as .valid record, but named to clarify it is really restrictive.  but,
there can be only a single .only given its method.

.nf
##min hrs day mon dow wks yrs
    B   15  4         22  .valid starting April 15 at 11p
     B         fr        .only allow during batch on fri

.SS .blackout
blackouts are the same as .valid, but usually specific dates or date ranges.
there can be multiple blackout enties and they will be additive.  meant for
holidays, vacations, outages, cut-overs, maintenance, etc.

.nf
##min hrs day mon dow wks yrs
        1   4         22   don't allow on Apr 1st, 2022

     B         fr         .only for maintenance job
     B         fr         .blackout for normal schedule

.SS .retire
retirement is exactly like .valid and is usually just a later date. if there
is no retirement, just do not include a .retire line at all.

.nf
##min hrs day mon dow wks yrs
    12  20  5         22  .valid after
